1. Initialize state variables:
    numStrings: an empty string
    strings: an empty array
    comparisonType: an empty string
    error: an empty string
    result: an empty array
2. Define a function named countVowelsAndConsonants which accepts a string as an argument and returns an array of arrays containing vowel and consonant counts and their positions respectively.

3. Define a functional component named App which renders the UI and manages state.

4. Inside the App component:
    4.1 Define state variables using the useState hook
    4.2 Define event handler functions:
        4.2.1 handleNumStringsChange which updates the numStrings state variable based on the user input
        4.2.2 handleStringChange which updates the strings state variable based on the user input
        4.2.3 handleComparisonTypeChange which updates the comparisonType state variable based on the user input
        4.2.4 showResult which counts the vowels and consonants in each string and updates the result state variable with the appropriate output
        4.2.5 handleSubmit which is called when the user submits the form and calls the showResult function

5. Render the UI using JSX, conditionally rendering the UI based on the state variables:
    5.1 If numStrings is an empty string, render the input field for numStrings
    5.2 Otherwise, render the form with input fields for each string and a dropdown to select the comparison type
        Render the result of the comparison, if any.
