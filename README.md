# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Pseudo Code
`1. Initialize state variables:
    numStrings: an empty string
    strings: an empty array
    comparisonType: an empty string
    error: an empty string
    result: an empty array
2. Define a function named countVowelsAndConsonants which accepts a string as an argument and returns an array of arrays containing vowel and consonant counts and their positions respectively.

3. Define a functional component named App which renders the UI and manages state.

4. Inside the App component:
    4.1 Define state variables using the useState hook
    4.2 Define event handler functions:
        4.2.1 handleNumStringsChange which updates the numStrings state variable based on the user input
        4.2.2 handleStringChange which updates the strings state variable based on the user input
        4.2.3 handleComparisonTypeChange which updates the comparisonType state variable based on the user input
        4.2.4 showResult which counts the vowels and consonants in each string and updates the result state variable with the appropriate output
        4.2.5 handleSubmit which is called when the user submits the form and calls the showResult function

5. Render the UI using JSX, conditionally rendering the UI based on the state variables:
    5.1 If numStrings is an empty string, render the input field for numStrings
    5.2 Otherwise, render the form with input fields for each string and a dropdown to select the comparison type
        Render the result of the comparison, if any.`
